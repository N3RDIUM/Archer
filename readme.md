# Archer

![Archer Logo](ArcherLogo.png)
A rusty ray tracing engine being built to run with a decent frame rate even on CPU, allowing for realtime raytracing applications without GPUs.
Every line of code is written with extensibility, hackability and the project's future in mind. Although it is kinda dirty at the moment, it will
get good eventually, possibly turning into the best ray tracer on the planet.

__Currently working on:__ Ray bounces, reflection, tiling/chunking for efficient parallelism.

- [x] Basic Sphere [Devlog 1]
- [ ] Multiple Reflections + BVH [Devlog 2]
- [ ] Refraction [Devlog 3]
- [ ] More stuff coming soon!
