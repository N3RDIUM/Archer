# NoRTX
A ray tracing engine built to run with a decent frame rate even on CPU, allowing for realtime raytracing applications without GPUs.

# Plan / Roadmap
- [x] All rays are collectively represented using numpy arrays.
- [ ] Intersect handlers for the 'sphere' primitive
- [ ] Intersect handlers for the 'plane' primitive
- [ ] Intersect handlers for other primitives
- [ ] Lights (Ambient, Point, Directional)
- [ ] Cornell Box Example
