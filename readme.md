# Archer
A ray tracing engine built to run with a decent frame rate even on CPU, allowing for realtime raytracing applications without GPUs.
All the code in this repo is heavily commented so that it is easy to follow.

## Latest render
This image shows what the engine is capable of as well as what I've been up to recently ;)
